# Titanic Survival Prediction – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the **Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster** dataset, one of the most iconic datasets for binary classification problems. The goal is to understand the data thoroughly before applying machine learning models to predict passenger survival.

## 📊 Project Overview

* **Objective**: Analyze Titanic passenger data to extract insights and understand the factors influencing survival.
* **Dataset**: The classic Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
* **File**: `titanic_EDA.ipynb` contains a comprehensive analysis and visualization of the dataset.

## 🧠 Key Analysis Steps

* Data loading and overview
* Missing value analysis and imputation
* Univariate analysis (distribution of individual features)
* Bivariate analysis (relationships between features and survival)
* Feature engineering suggestions based on insights
* Visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib

## 📁 Files Included

* `titanic_EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with all EDA steps and visualizations.
* (Optional) `train.csv` and `test.csv`: Titanic dataset files if you plan to include them locally.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

## 📸 Sample Visuals

Includes plots such as:

* Passenger survival by gender and class
* Age distribution among survivors and non-survivors
* Heatmaps for correlation analysis
* Fare and Age boxplots

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-eda.git
   cd titanic-eda
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook titanic_EDA.ipynb
   ```

3. Ensure `train.csv` is in the same directory as the notebook.

## 📌 Future Work

* Implement predictive models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
* Perform hyperparameter tuning
* Use cross-validation and evaluate model performance
